If we don't manage problems due to waste which is increasing day by day, society has to face it's ill consequences. Our team has comeup with a good solution, which is to produce new high quality products from it. Introducing these products to the market would serve as a good income. Moreover, our team will also be bying home-made handicrafts. The suppliers have the opportunity to sell through us.

The speciality of our project is the usage of harmful waste products for this.We can gain many benifits from it. It creates a market for domestic entrepreneurs to sell their own products. As well as it helps to control waste pollution. Our process of all the productions is environmental friendly. We minimize all the machine usage in our process. We mostly use human power to our productions. We hope to see a fruitful outcome through this.

There are many economic and social benefits.We hope, our project fulfills what we need to fulfill responsibility, consumption and production.
